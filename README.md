Booking Test
============

The project should consist of two pages:

Booking (Page 1)
Quite often clients will phone into a restaurant and a customer’s booking need to be captured into the system.
This should be a simple page that allows a user to capture the details of a diner.  The diners details might include fields such as:

First Name
Last Name
Dining Date
Number of Covers (How many people?)
Phone Number
Email

If you need to store state when updating the booking page – you can use Cookies or LocalStorage.

Seating (Page 2)
At the reception desk of a restaurant, the concierge will look at a list of diners and mark them as seated.
This page should pull in data that you captured in Booking.
The page should allow the concierge to mark a diner at two stages, and might include a simple drop down with two values:
Not arrived
Seated


The test needs to be done using HTML and JavaScript but the rest is up to you.
Overall we are just going to be using this code to understand how your brain works!
